    "## ARRAYS\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, a list in Python is an ordered set of values, such as a set of\n",
    "integers or a set of floats. There is another object in Python that is somewhat\n",
    "similar, an array. An array is also an ordered set of values, but there are some\n",
    "important differences between lists and arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of elements in an array is fixed. You cannot add elements to an array once it is created, or remove them.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The elements of an array must all be of the same type, such as all floats or all integers. You cannot mix elements of different types in the same array and you cannot change the type of the elements once an array is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists, as we have seen, have neither of these restrictions and, on the face of\n",
    "it, these seem like significant drawbacks of the array. Why would we ever\n",
    "use an array if lists are more flexible? The answer is that arrays have several\n",
    "significant advantages over lists as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arrays can be two-dimensional, like matrices in algebra. That is, rather than just a one-dimensional row of elements, we can have a grid of them. Indeed, arrays can in principle have any number of dimensions, including three or more, although we won’t use dimensions above two in this book. Lists, by contrast, are always just one-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Arrays behave roughly like vectors or matrices: you can do arithmetic with them, such as adding them together, and you will get the result you expect. This is not true with lists. If you try to do arithmetic with a list you will either get an error message, or you will not get the result you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Arrays work faster than lists. Especially if you have a very large array with many elements then calculations may be significantly faster using an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics it often happens that we are working with a fixed number of elements all of the same type, as when we are working with matrices or vectors,for instance. In that case, arrays are clearly the tool of choice: the fact that we cannot add or remove elements is immaterial if we never need to do such a thing, and the superior speed of arrays and their flexibility in other respects can make a significant difference to our programs. We will use arrays extensively in this book—far more than we will use lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you use an array you need to create it, meaning you need to tell the\n",
    "computer how many elements it will have and of what type. Python provides\n",
    "functions that allow you do this in several different ways. These functions are\n",
    "all found in the package numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, we can create a one-dimensional array with n elements, all of which are initially equal to zero, using the function zeros fromthe numpy package. The function takes two arguments. The first is the number\n",
    "of elements the array is to have and the second is the type of the elements,\n",
    "such as int, float, or complex. For instance, to create a new array with four\n",
    "floating-point elements we would do the following:\n"
